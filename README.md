🚦 US Accidents Analysis
Exploring patterns in accidents based on time, weather, and location using the US Accidents dataset

📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the US Accidents (2016–2023) dataset to uncover:

🕒 When accidents are most likely to occur

🌦 Weather conditions that contribute to accidents

📅 Day-wise patterns of accidents

🗺 Location-based insights (e.g., near amenities)

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents

📊 Key Insights
1️⃣ Accidents by Hour of Day
Peak hours: 7–8 AM and 4–6 PM → Rush hours are most accident-prone.

Least accidents: 2–4 AM (late night).

2️⃣ Accidents by Day of Week
Weekdays (Mon–Fri) show the highest accident counts.

Friday leads as the most dangerous day.

Accidents drop significantly on weekends.

3️⃣ Weather Impact
Most accidents occur in "Fair" weather (clear skies), not during storms.

Other frequent conditions: Cloudy, Mostly Cloudy.

Rain, Fog, and Snow contribute fewer accidents but may involve higher severity.

4️⃣ Accidents near Amenities
Most accidents occur away from amenities (like gas stations & rest areas), implying highway & high-speed zones are riskier.
