🚦 US Accidents Analysis
📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the US Accidents (2016–2023) dataset to uncover patterns in traffic accidents across the United States.
The focus is on identifying high-risk times, days, weather conditions, and locations, helping stakeholders enhance road safety and allocate resources effectively.

Dataset: 
Source : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents

Size: ~7.7M accident records across 49 US states (2016–2023)

Features Used:

Temporal: Hour of day, day of week

Weather: Weather condition, visibility, temperature

Location: Accident coordinates, near amenities

Severity: Accident severity levels

Target: No explicit target (Exploratory Data Analysis).

📊 Key Insights
1️⃣ Accidents by Hour of Day
Peak hours: 7–8 AM and 4–6 PM → Rush hours are most accident-prone.
Least accidents: 2–4 AM (late night).

2️⃣ Accidents by Day of Week
Weekdays (Mon–Fri) show the highest accident counts.
Friday leads as the most dangerous day.
Accidents drop significantly on weekends.

3️⃣ Weather Impact
Most accidents occur in "Fair" weather (clear skies), not during storms.
Other frequent conditions: Cloudy, Mostly Cloudy.
Rain, Fog, and Snow contribute fewer accidents but may involve higher severity.

4️⃣ Accidents near Amenities
Most accidents occur away from amenities (like gas stations & rest areas), implying highway & high-speed zones are riskier.
